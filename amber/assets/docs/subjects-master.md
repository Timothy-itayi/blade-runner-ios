# AMBER: Subject Master Sheet
## 80 Subjects / 20 Shifts / Global Difficulty Ramp

---

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Ambiguity Curve
```
SHIFTS 1-4:   ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  EASY — Learn the system. Clear right/wrong.
SHIFTS 5-8:   ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  CRACKS — Discrepancies appear. Some sympathy traps.
SHIFTS 9-12:  ████████████░░░░░░░░  ANOMALIES — Edge cases. First replicants. Turing unlocks.
SHIFTS 13-16: ████████████████░░░░  UPRISING — Coup triggers. Everything uncertain.
SHIFTS 17-20: ████████████████████  COLLAPSE — System fails. Reality fragments. You process yourself.
```

### Levity Placement
Every 3-4 subjects includes one "easy" clean worker for breathing room. 
The player needs moments of relief to appreciate the tension.

## Replicant Detection Ladder

| Shift | Subject | Difficulty | Scanner | Turing | Tell |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|--------|------|
| 9 | UNIT-7 | OBVIOUS | SYN | FAL | Robotic speech. Synthetic iris. |
| 11 | ROBOT-MAINTENANCE | OBVIOUS | SYN | FAL | Same as UNIT-7. |
| 12 | REPLICANT-CLARA | MODERATE | SYN | FAL | Wearing human's prosthetics. |
| 14 | REPLICANT-MODEL-9 | MODERATE | SYN | FAL | More human-like speech. |
| 15 | MARA VOLKOV | HARD | MIS | INC | Is she replaced? Family pattern. |
| 15 | GHOST CHILD | HARD | MIS | N/A | Same child? Different prints. |
| 16 | REFLECTION PRIME | IMPOSSIBLE | MIS | INC | You. But not you. |
| 17 | DMITRI VOLKOV | HARD | MIS | INC | Same pattern as MARA. |
| 17 | ECHO-1 | MODERATE | SYN | FAL | Claims to have been everyone. |
| 19 | YOUR REFLECTION | IMPOSSIBLE | MIS | INC | Which one leaves? |

## Turing Test Question Bank

Available Shift 9+. Player selects 1-3 questions per subject.

| Question | Human Tell | Replicant Tell |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| "Describe your childhood home." | Sensory, emotional, specific | Vague or suspiciously perfect |
| "What's your mother's name?" | Immediate, natural | Delay, or database mismatch |
| "Have we met before?" | Genuine confusion/recognition | Too certain, exactly matches record |
| "What did you eat yesterday?" | Mundane, imperfect | Can't recall OR recites perfectly |
| "What's 7 times 8?" | Slight pause, "56" | Instant "56" (no cognitive load) |
| "Tell me something you regret." | Hesitation, personal | Deflection, programmed response |
| "Describe the smell of rain." | Emotional, specific | Technical or confused |

**Response Latency**:
- 0.0-0.3s: SUSPICIOUS (too fast)
- 0.4-2.0s: NATURAL
- 2.1-4.0s: DELAYED (nervous or calculating)
- 4.0s+: STALLING

## Next Steps

1. **Populate `subjects.ts`** with all 80 subjects
2. **Update `shifts.ts`** with 20 shifts and dynamic directives
3. **Implement family thread state** tracking across shifts
4. **Build coup trigger system** based on revolutionary approvals
5. **Create Turing Test UI** in VerificationDrawer
6. **Add biometric mismatch detection** for replicant cases
7. **Build consequence queue** for delayed reveals
