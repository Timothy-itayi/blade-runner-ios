### Script

*[News anchor tone - somber, concerned]*

A woman identified as Eva Prom was found in a dissociative state at Central Transit Hub earlier today... repeatedly asking passersby for directions to an address that does not exist.

When confronted about a man named "Jacob Price," she became increasingly agitated.

Medical teams have since confirmed synthetic markers in her bloodwork.

Authorities are now questioning how she passed border screening.

### Voice Direction
- Professional news anchor delivery
- Somber, slightly tragic undertone
- Pause slightly before "synthetic markers" for emphasis
- End with subtle concern/suspicion on the final line
