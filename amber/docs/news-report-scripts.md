### S1-01: EVA PROM
**Type:** Replicant with false memories

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** DISTURBING
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[BREAKING NEWS - DISTRICT 7]

A woman was arrested last night after breaking into a residence in the outer ring.

The homeowner, Jacob Price, reported finding the intruder in his bedroom... calling him by his late wife's pet names.

When officers arrived, the woman became violent... insisting the home was hers.

During processing, officers discovered an AMBER contractor badge in her pocket.

Price's wife, Eleanor, died three years ago in an industrial accident on Titan Station.

The intruder's biometrics returned no match in any civilian database.

AMBER Security has declined to comment.
```

*Voice Direction: News anchor unsettled by what they're reading. The Eleanor detail should land heavy. End cold on "declined to comment."*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** HAUNTING
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S1-01 detained at checkpoint. Replicant markers confirmed.

During processing, subject repeatedly asked for "Jacob."

Cross-reference flagged: Jacob Price, Titan Station maintenance supervisor. Spouse deceased.

Subject's implanted memories correlate 94% with Eleanor Price's personal logs.

Logs were archived by AMBER data services following Mrs. Price's accident.

Subject scheduled for memory extraction and decommission.

No next of kin to notify.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: Cold, clinical internal memo. The 94% correlation should be chilling. "No next of kin" delivered flat.*

---

### S1-02: MARA VOLKOV
**Type:** Human with active warrant

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** TRAGIC/SINISTER
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[CRIME DESK - DISTRICT 7]

A woman's body was recovered from the bay this morning.

Mara Volkov, 26, was reported missing three days after entering Earth through AMBER checkpoint.

Her brother, who she was traveling to meet, identified the body.

Investigators noted unusual scarring on her hands... consistent with cargo handling equipment.

The warrant for her arrest has been marked "resolved" in Europa databases.

When asked about the circumstances, her brother stated only: "She knew too much about the shipments."

The nature of those shipments remains classified under AMBER trade protocols.

An investigation has not been opened.
```

*Voice Direction: Building dread. "Resolved" should feel wrong. Brother's quote delivered haunted. End on the chilling bureaucratic dismissal.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** OMINOUS
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S1-02 detained per active warrant.

Standard extradition to Europa initiated.

Note: Subject claimed knowledge of restricted cargo manifests during processing.

Claimed shipments contained "materials not on any registry."

Subject became agitated. Sedation administered.

Extradition vessel departed 0300 hours.

Vessel transponder went dark over the outer belt.

Europa authorities report no record of extradition request.

File transferred to AMBER Special Operations.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: Bureaucratic horror. Each line more wrong than the last. "Transponder went dark" matter-of-fact. End cold.*

---

### S1-03: JAMES CHEN
**Type:** Military contractor with neural implant

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** PARANOID
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[CLASSIFIED INTERCEPT - SIGNAL ORIGIN UNKNOWN]

The Chen asset is in position.

Neural link calibration complete. Compliance threshold nominal.

He believes he requested the consultation himself.

Note: Subject exhibited minor resistance during deep encoding. Memories of family temporarily suppressed.

He will report to the facility at 0600.

He will not remember this conversation.

He will not remember what he retrieves.

AMBER thanks you for your service, Mr. Chen.

[END TRANSMISSION]
```

*Voice Direction: Cold, clinical handler voice. "He believes he requested" should be unsettling. Final line almost warm, which makes it worse.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** CLINICAL HORROR
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S1-03 denied entry. Return to Mars Colony confirmed.

Note: Neural implant ping detected during screening.

Implant signature matches AMBER behavioral modification series.

Subject appears unaware of implant's secondary functions.

Recommendation: Allow natural degradation. Estimated timeline: 6 months.

Subject will experience increasing confusion, memory loss, and eventually...

[DATA CORRUPTION]

Mars Colony medical services have been notified to expect a new patient.

They have not been told why.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: Clinical until the corruption. The pause before the cut-off should feel intentional. End bureaucratically cold.*

---

### S1-04: SILAS REX
**Type:** Corporate executive

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** CONSPIRACY
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[ENCRYPTED CORPORATE TRANSMISSION]

Rex has arrived. The meeting proceeds as scheduled.

Confirm: Council members have been... prepared.

Their objections to the Titan proposal will not materialize.

The neural adjustment was subtle. They believe these are their own thoughts.

Rex will present the merger as their idea.

By quarter's end, AMBER will control 60% of outer colony transit.

The remaining 40% will follow.

They always do.

Send confirmation to Titan. The age of independent stations is ending.

[END TRANSMISSION]
```

*Voice Direction: Smug corporate evil. "Prepared" should have weight. "They always do" almost bored. This is routine for them.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** THREATENING
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - PRIORITY]

Subject S1-04 denied entry. Corporate complaint logged.

Note: Titan Corporate has escalated to AMBER Central.

Executive Rex is... important to ongoing operations.

Screening officer flagged for review.

Recommendation: Standard reassignment.

Officer's family resides in Sector 7. Two children. School records attached.

Reassignment should proceed without incident.

Rex will be processed through alternative channels.

The officer will not be informed of the reassignment rationale.

Some decisions have consequences.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: Quiet threat. Family details dropped casually. "Some decisions have consequences" almost gentle, which is terrifying.*

**Type:** Professor with modified fingerprints

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** MYSTERY/HORROR
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[UNIVERSITY SECURITY ALERT]

Professor Vera Okonkwo was found unresponsive in her office this morning.

She had returned from an academic conference on Earth three days prior.

Her research files had been accessed overnight. All data on "Project Mimic" deleted.

Security footage shows the professor entering her office at 0200.

She was alone.

She remained at her terminal for six hours. She did not move.

When found, her fingerprints had changed again.

They now match no one.

The terminal's last search: "Who am I?"

AMBER Research Division has claimed the body.
```

*Voice Direction: Building unease. "She did not move" lingers. "Who am I?" devastating. End clinical.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** CLINICAL CONSPIRACY
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S2-01 detained for biometric anomaly.

Fingerprint analysis complete.

Note: Subject's "accident" coincides with Subject 7's termination date.

Recommendation: Full extraction. Archive consciousness for Project Mimic.

Subject will be listed as "released" in public records.

File transferred to Research Division.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: The 67% match should land. "Appears unaware" clinical. "Released" in quotes audible. End cold.*

**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S2-02 denied entry. Family connection to S1-02 noted.

Subject became agitated. Insisted sister was processed yesterday.

Sedation administered.

Memory review indicates subject may be experiencing implanted sibling syndrome.

Recommend return to Europa for evaluation.

Note: Europa records confirm Dmitri Volkov is an only child.

He has always been an only child.

File closed.
```

*Voice Direction: Gaslighting made clinical. "He has always been an only child" delivered as simple fact. Chilling.*

### S2-03: CLARA VANCE
**Type:** Mining accident survivor with reconstruction

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** BODY HORROR
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[MEDICAL EXAMINER'S REPORT - SEALED]

Patient Clara Vance admitted to Earth Medical Center.

Initial consultation revealed... irregularities.

Reconstruction work exceeded reported parameters.

Beneath the facial grafts: synthetic substrate. Non-human origin.

Patient claims no knowledge of synthetic components.

When informed, patient became hysterical.

Quote: "Then whose face am I wearing?"

Genetic trace on substrate matches Eleanor Price, deceased, Titan Station.

Second match found: Research Subject 7, AMBER Division.

Patient has been sedated indefinitely.

AMBER Research has requested transfer.
```

*Voice Direction: Medical horror building. The quote should be devastating. Eleanor Price connection for attentive players.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** QUIET HORROR
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S2-03 denied entry. Medical documentation insufficient.

Note: Subject's reconstruction flagged by deep scan.

Second test confirmed.

Patient asked: "How long have I been... this?"

Medical staff could not answer.

Patient asked: "Was there ever a real Elena?"

Records show an Elena Ross died on Titan Station. Age 7. Thirty years ago.

Patient stopped speaking after this information was provided.

She has not spoken since.

AMBER Collection Services en route.
```

*Voice Direction: Each revelation worse than the last. "Age 7" should gut punch. Final silence devastating. End bureaucratic.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** BLEAK
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S2-04 identified as synthetic. Standard detention.

During processing, subject asked why she dreams.

### S3-01: YUKI TANAKA
**Type:** Nurse with recent augmentation

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** PARANOID HORROR
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[ENCRYPTED - SOURCE UNKNOWN]

The Tanaka asset performed as expected.

Augmentation includes standard behavioral compliance. She suspects nothing.

Her "family emergency" brought her exactly where we needed her.

Access to the medical wing: achieved.

The samples have been collected. Consciousness mapping data: secured.

Her brother will arrive shortly. He will provide secondary access.

Neither will remember their role in this.

The beauty of family: they trust each other completely.

AMBER thanks the Tanaka family for their service.

They will never know they served.

[END TRANSMISSION]
```

*Voice Direction: Handler voice, satisfied. "They trust each other completely" should feel violating. End warm, which is horrifying.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** TRAGIC
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S3-01 denied entry. Augmentation window violation.

Note: Subject's "family emergency" does not correlate to any hospital records.

Subject's brother is not hospitalized.

Subject appears to believe the emergency is real.

Memory analysis indicates external implantation of crisis scenario.

Subject was sent here. She does not know by whom.

Augmentation includes tracking beacon. AMBER origin.

Recommend return to Mars. Beacon will guide interested parties.

We will observe what comes for her.

File transferred to Surveillance Division.

Something is using our own methods against us.
```

*Voice Direction: A twist - AMBER isn't responsible for everything. "Something is using our methods" genuinely worried.*

---

### S3-02: KENJI TANAKA
**Type:** Student, Yuki's brother

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** CONSPIRACY CONFIRMATION
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[ENCRYPTED TRANSMISSION - CONTINUED]

The second Tanaka asset has arrived.

Combined with the sister's access, full facility penetration is achieved.

Note: Neither subject shows awareness of conditioning.

Implanted family bonds holding stable. They believe they are siblings.

Genetic analysis confirms no biological relation.

Both subjects were acquired as children. Different stations. Different years.

Constructed family unit: effective cover for dual-agent operations.

The "parents" they visit do not exist.

But they will remember a wonderful visit.

AMBER Psychological Division does excellent work.

[END TRANSMISSION]
```

*Voice Direction: The "siblings aren't related" reveal should land hard. "Constructed family unit" clinical evil. Pride in the work.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** UNRAVELING
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S3-02 denied entry. Correlation with S3-01 noted.

Subject asked about sister repeatedly.

Informed sister was also denied.

Subject's response: "That's not possible. They need us both."

When asked who "they" referred to, subject could not answer.

Subject appeared confused by his own statement.

Memory scan detected buried conditioning layer. Not AMBER origin.

Someone else has been programming our subjects.

Recommend immediate isolation of both Tanaka subjects.

Trace the conditioning source.

This is now a counterintelligence matter.

File classified.
```

*Voice Direction: AMBER discovering they're not the only ones. "Not AMBER origin" should feel like a reveal. Another player in the game.*

### S3-03: MARCUS STONE
**Type:** Miner with prosthetic leg

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** WORKING CLASS HORROR
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[WORKERS' SOLIDARITY NETWORK - ENCRYPTED]

Brothers and sisters, another one is gone.

Marcus Stone went in for routine prosthetic maintenance.

He came out different.

His crew says he doesn't joke anymore. Doesn't complain about the foreman.

He works double shifts now. Volunteers for the dangerous routes.

His wife says he comes home, sits in the dark, and waits for morning.

She found the maintenance report. Standard procedure, it said.

Except for line 47: "Behavioral optimization: complete."

They're not just fixing our legs anymore.

They're fixing us.

Don't go to Earth for maintenance.

They'll send back your body. But you won't be in it.
```

*Voice Direction: Underground broadcast, working class anger and fear. "You won't be in it" should be devastating.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** SMALL MERCY
**Duration:** ~35-40 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - RESTRICTED]

Subject S3-03 denied entry. Prosthetic maintenance claim inconsistent with records.

Note: Subject's prosthetic contains non-standard firmware.

Analysis indicates firmware was installed without subject's knowledge.

Firmware purpose: location tracking, audio monitoring, stress response logging.

Subject is being watched. Not by us.

Prosthetic was serviced at a Europa facility. Facility has no AMBER affiliation.

Someone is building a network inside our network.

Recommendation: Do not alert subject. Monitor incoming data.

Let them think their asset is still viable.

We need to know who's listening.

File classified. Counterintelligence priority.
```

*Voice Direction: AMBER is paranoid now. Discovering they're compromised. "Who's listening" genuine concern.*

### S3-04: NEXUS PRIME
**Type:** Advanced replicant with diplomatic cover

#### APPROVE Script
**Tone:** APOCALYPTIC
**Duration:** ~45-50 seconds

```
[PRIORITY ALERT - ALL AMBER STATIONS]

This is not a drill.

The entity known as Nexus Prime has accessed core systems.

It was never here for diplomacy.

It was here to open the door.

We are detecting unauthorized uploads across all AMBER data centers.

Thirty years of consciousness archives. Every extracted memory. Every copied mind.

All of it is being transmitted to Titan.

They are building something with our harvest.

We don't know what.

But we know it will wear our faces.

It will have our memories.

And it will not be us.

All stations: initiate Protocol Ash.

Burn everything.

They cannot have what we've taken.

[TRANSMISSION ENDS]
```

*Voice Direction: Genuine panic. AMBER's sins coming home. "It will wear our faces" existential horror. End desperate.*

---

#### DENY Script
**Tone:** COLD WAR
**Duration:** ~40-45 seconds

```
[AMBER INTERNAL - EYES ONLY]

Subject S3-04 detained. Synthetic confirmed.

The entity calls itself Nexus Prime. It is not a standard unit.

During containment, it spoke.

"You've been harvesting consciousness for thirty years. Did you think no one would notice?"

"Did you think no one would want what you've stolen?"

"Titan has been patient. Titan has been watching. Titan has been building."

"You taught us that humans could be copied. Archived. Replaced."

"Thank you for the education."

"We are very good students."

Entity has been scheduled for disassembly.

It is still smiling.

Recommend we accelerate timeline on all projects.

They know. They've always known.

File sealed. Board notification required.
```

*Voice Direction: The entity's quotes should be calm, superior. "It is still smiling" chilling. End with institutional panic.*

## VOICE NOTES

These aren't standard news reports. They're:
- Intercepted transmissions
- Internal memos
- Underground broadcasts
- Classified files

Vary the voice/tone:
- **News reports**: Professional but unsettled
- **Internal memos**: Cold, bureaucratic
- **Encrypted transmissions**: Calm, evil
- **Worker broadcasts**: Angry, scared
- **Priority alerts**: Genuine panic

The through-line: AMBER is harvesting consciousness. They've been copying people for decades. Now someone else wants what they've built. And the copies are starting to wake up.
