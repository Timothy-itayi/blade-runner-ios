### Script

*[News anchor tone - urgent, concerned]*

A coordinated raid on a suspected safe house in District Seven came up empty tonight... after Mara Volkov, wanted in connection with restricted cargo theft on Europa, successfully evaded detention.

Security officials are reviewing border screening procedures after the suspect apparently passed through AMBER checkpoints... despite flagged warrant status.

Her brother, Dmitri Volkov, is now being sought for questioning.

This is a developing story.

### Voice Direction
- Urgent, breaking news energy
- Emphasis on "came up empty" - frustration implied
- "despite flagged warrant status" should carry weight - implying failure
- End with standard "developing story" tag, slightly ominous
