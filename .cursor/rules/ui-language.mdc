# AMBER: UI & Language Guidelines

## Language Philosophy

**Simple. Direct. No jargon.**

Players should understand in under 2 seconds. If they have to re-read, it's too long.

---

## Writing Rules

1. **One idea per line**
2. **Verbs first** (DENY, ALLOW, SEND, FIX)
3. **No corporate speak** (no "optimization", "implementation")
4. **Plain consequences** (no euphemisms that obscure meaning)

---

## Good vs Bad Examples

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Subject status updated to TERMINAL following discharge" | "They don't come back." |
| "PRIMARY: DENY ALL OFF-WORLD ENGINEERS. EXCEPTION: HUMAN ENGINEERS ARE EXEMPT" | "DENY: ENGINEERS / EXCEPT: HUMANS" |
| "Awaiting feature implementation" | "AWAITING ASSIGNMENT" |
| "Route to secondary transit node" | "Route to another station." |

---

## Resolution Prompt Format

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [NAME]                             │
│  DENIED — AWAITING ASSIGNMENT       │
│                                     │
│  ▸ SEND                             │
│    Route to another station.        │
│    Opens new path on map.           │
│                                     │
│  ▸ FIX                              │
│    Modify and requeue.              │
│    They come back changed.          │
│                                     │
│  ▸ PASS                             │
│    Send to higher authority.        │
│    You won't see what happens.      │
│                                     │
│  ▸ HOLD                             │
│    Store indefinitely.              │
│    Frozen. Not gone.                │
│                                     │
│  ▸ RELEASE                          │
│    Let go. Off-grid.                │
│    They don't come back.            │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Directive Display Format

Simple:
```
DENY: WARRANTS
```

With exception:
```
DENY: ENGINEERS
EXCEPT: HUMANS
```

Stacked:
```
DENY: REPLICANTS
EXCEPT: VIP
EXCEPT: MEDICAL
```

---

## Button Labels

| Action | Label |
|--------|-------|
| Approve subject | APPROVE |
| Deny subject | DENY |
| Route elsewhere | SEND |
| Modify subject | FIX |
| Send to authority | PASS |
| Store indefinitely | HOLD |
| Release off-grid | RELEASE |
| Continue | CONTINUE |
| Start shift | BEGIN SHIFT |

---

## AMBER Messages

Corporate. Hollow. Bureaucratic. Doesn't acknowledge deaths.

**Examples:**
```
"SHIFT COMPLETE. PROCESSING EFFICIENCY: ACCEPTABLE. GOOD WORK, OPERATOR."
```

```
"3 SUBJECTS PROCESSED. THROUGHPUT WITHIN PARAMETERS. AMBER THANKS YOU."
```

```
"SHIFT 1 CONCLUDED. 0 CITATIONS. 0 WARNINGS. CONTINUE TO NEXT SHIFT."
```

---

## Theme: Cassette Futurism

From `theme.ts`:

| Token | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| bgDark | #20242c | Main background |
| bgPanel | #2a2f38 | Panel backgrounds |
| textPrimary | #e2d3bf | Main text |
| textDim | #8f816f | Muted text |
| accentDeny | #d4534a | Red / Deny |
| accentApprove | #4a8a5a | Green / Approve |
| accentWarn | #c9a227 | Yellow / Warning |
| industrialCream | #d8c3a6 | Buttons |

**Font:** ShareTechMono — terminal aesthetic

---

## Component Patterns

- **MechanicalButton**: Physical press animation, shadow depth
- **HUDBox**: Bordered panels with mechanical styling
- **Typewriter effect**: For subject dialogue and AMBER messages
