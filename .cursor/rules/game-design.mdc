# AMBER: Game Design Reference

## One-Line Pitch

A border control game where every decision creates consequences you must see — and live with.

---

## Core Loop

```
PROCESS → DECIDE → SEE CONSEQUENCES → RESOLVE DENIALS → REPEAT
```

1. **Process**: Subjects appear at checkpoint. Player investigates.
2. **Decide**: Approve or Deny based on directive.
3. **See**: Node map shows what happened. Who lived. Who died.
4. **Resolve**: Denied subjects become "bugs." Player chooses: SEND, FIX, PASS, HOLD, or RELEASE.
5. **Repeat**: Next shift. Directive changes. Complexity grows.

---

## Design Pillars

1. **Full Transparency** — Player sees exactly what happened and why
2. **No Recovery** — Choices permanent, no undo
3. **No Judgment** — Game shows consequences, doesn't preach
4. **Player-Authored Story** — Decisions create the narrative

---

## The Setting: Year 3184

- **AMBER** = Transit hub in Earth orbit
- **Player** = Checkpoint operator processing subjects
- **Locations**: Earth, Mars, Europa, Titan, Io, The Void, Archive, Central

---

## Subject Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| HUMAN | Baseline Earth-origin |
| REPLICANT | Synthetic human |
| HYBRID | Human with augments |
| CONSTRUCT | Fully synthetic |
| REMNANT | Post-human, degraded |
| UNKNOWN | Classification pending |

---

## Directive System

Each shift has rules. Clear. Binary.

```
DENY: [CATEGORY]
EXCEPT: [CONDITION]
```

**Examples:**
- `DENY: WARRANTS` (simple)
- `DENY: ENGINEERS / EXCEPT: HUMANS` (one exception)
- `DENY: REPLICANTS / EXCEPT: VIP / EXCEPT: MEDICAL` (stacked)

---

## Node Map

Visual representation of all decisions.

**Node States:**
- Green = Approved, no harm
- Red = Approved, caused harm
- Gray = Denied correctly
- Yellow = Denied incorrectly
- Blue = Held
- Empty = Released (gone)

**Edges:**
- Solid = Decision (you → subject)
- Dashed = Consequence (subject → subject)
- Red = Death chain

---

## Bug Resolution (5 Options)

After each shift, denied subjects need resolution:

| Option | Effect | Map Visual |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **SEND** | Route to another station | New branch |
| **FIX** | Modify and requeue | Successor node |
| **PASS** | Send to higher authority | Faded connection |
| **HOLD** | Store indefinitely | Frozen (X) |
| **RELEASE** | Let go off-grid | Empty node (gone) |

---

## The Wrapped

End-of-shift Spotify Wrapped-style summary:
- Stats: Processed, Approved, Denied, Casualties
- Node map preview
- AMBER message: "Good work, Operator."

---

## Language Guidelines

- **One idea per line**
- **Verbs first** (DENY, ALLOW, SEND, FIX)
- **No corporate jargon**
- **Plain consequences** ("They don't come back" not "Status: TERMINAL")

---

## Development Phases

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | Core Loop (process → decide → feedback) |
| 2 | Directive System (DENY/EXCEPT rules) |
| 3 | Node Map (decision visualization) |
| 4 | Bug Resolution (5 options) |
| 5 | The Wrapped (stats summary) |
| 6 | Content (36 subjects, 9 shifts) |

---

## MVP Scope

- 3 shifts, 9 subjects
- 3 directives
- 3 consequence chains
- Full loop playable
