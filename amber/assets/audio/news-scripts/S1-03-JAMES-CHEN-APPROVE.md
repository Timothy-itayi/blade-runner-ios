### Script

*[News anchor tone - measured, subtly ominous]*

Security officials at a restricted medical facility are investigating unauthorized data access... following what was described as a routine calibration appointment.

A source familiar with the matter indicated the breach involved classified neural interface specifications.

The subject of the appointment, a military contractor from Mars Colony, has not been charged.

Officials declined to comment on whether border screening protocols were followed.

### Voice Direction
- Measured, intelligence briefing style
- "routine calibration appointment" - slight irony/skepticism
- "has not been charged" - leave it hanging, imply more to come
- Final line delivered with subtle accusation - something went wrong
