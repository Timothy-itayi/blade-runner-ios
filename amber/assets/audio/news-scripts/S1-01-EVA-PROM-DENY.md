### Script

*[News anchor tone - confident, authoritative]*

AMBER Security successfully identified and detained a Nexus-series replicant attempting entry under false pretenses today.

The subject, designated Eva Prom, exhibited classic signs of implanted memory syndrome... insisting on the existence of a romantic partner with no corresponding records.

Quote: "This is exactly the kind of threat our screening process is designed to catch," stated border officials.

### Voice Direction
- Confident, official news tone
- Slight satisfaction/pride when mentioning "successfully identified"
- Clinical when describing "implanted memory syndrome"
- Quote should sound like reading an official statement
