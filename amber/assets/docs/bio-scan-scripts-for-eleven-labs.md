## Instructions for Eleven Labs

1. Use a **clinical, monotone, medical professional voice** (like a doctor reading test results)
2. Speak at a **moderate pace** - not rushed, but efficient
3. Use **medical terminology** naturally
4. Pause briefly between sections (retinal scan, dermal analysis, etc.)
5. Keep tone **neutral and professional** - no emotion
