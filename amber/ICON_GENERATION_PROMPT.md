# AMBER App Icon Generation Prompt

## App Overview
**AMBER** (Active Measures Bureau for Entity Review) is a Blade Runner-inspired surveillance state verification simulator for iOS. Players act as Operator OP-7734, processing subjects requesting transit between sectors in a dystopian bureaucratic system.

## Icon Design Specifications

### Core Concept
The icon should represent **AMBER** as a surveillance/verification system. Think: a terminal window, an eye scanner, a verification stamp, or a combination of these elements.

### Design Elements to Consider

1. **Terminal Window**
   - Rounded square with amber border
   - Dark background
   - Monospace text or code-like pattern
   - Scanline effect or grid overlay

2. **Eye Scanner**
   - Circular or hexagonal scan pattern
   - Amber/cyan glow
   - Retinal scan aesthetic
   - Minimalist geometric pattern

3. **Verification Stamp**
   - Square or rectangular stamp shape
   - "AMBER" text in monospace
   - Operator code (OP-7734) or similar
   - Approval/denial indicator

4. **Grid/Matrix Pattern**
   - Technical grid overlay
   - Data visualization aesthetic
   - Sector map reference
   - Surveillance grid

## Technical Requirements

### Dimensions
- **iOS**: 1024x1024px (required for App Store)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Background**: Can be transparent or solid dark (#0A0C0F)

### Readability at Small Sizes
- Text must be legible at 60x60px (home screen)
- Avoid fine details that blur at small sizes
- High contrast between elements
- Bold, simple shapes preferred

### iOS Icon Guidelines
- No transparency (iOS will add rounded corners automatically)
- Safe area: Keep important elements within 80% of icon area
- Avoid text if possible (use symbols/shapes instead)
- If text is used, make it large and bold


## File Location
Save the generated icon as:
- `amber/assets/images/icon.png` (1024x1024px)

## Testing
After generating, test the icon at various sizes:
- 60x60px (home screen)
- 120x120px (home screen @2x)
- 180x180px (home screen @3x)
- 1024x1024px (App Store)

Ensure text and key elements remain legible at all sizes.
